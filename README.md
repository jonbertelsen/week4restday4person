## Person REST API for flow 2, week 1 with Person and Address entities
- Generic Exception mappers are included
- Facade test included
- Rest assured test included

## Flow 2 week 1
In this week we begin using json errormessages. The folder errorhandling is added to the project containing: 
- ExceptionDTO
- GenericExceptionMapper
With that addition, error message will be converted to json when a rest endpoint is called. Even a 404.
Execute > git clone -b errorhandling git@github.com:dat3startcode/dat3-startcode.git to clone the version of the startcode with errorhandling
